All Perlbal configuration commands: (case insensitive)
===================================

Admin commands:
- - - - - - - -
shutdown                   -- shuts down the server, killing all active connections
shutdown graceful          -- closes listening sockets and stays alive until clients bleed off

create pool <name>               -- create an empty pool
pool <name> add    <ip[:port]>   -- add a node to a pool
pool <name> remove <ip[:port]>   -- remove a node to a pool
set <pool>.<param> = <value>     -- set a property on a pool:
   ....

create service <name>              -- create an empty service
set <service>.<param> = <value>    -- set a property on a service

   Service params:
   ---------------
      role = What this service does: One of "reverse_proxy",
             "web_server", "management", or "selector".  Required.

      listen = What ip:port this service listens on, in form of
             "a.b.c.d:port".  Necessary for pool to work, unless a
             selector sends a client here, and the selector is
             listening.

      trusted_upstream_proxies = For'reverse_proxy mode, what netmask
                                 (see Net::Netmask) of IPs we trust as
                                 our own, and therefore will respect
                                 the X-Forwarded-For headers and not
                                 overwrite with our own.

      always_trusted = For reverse_proxy mode, boolean value
                       (1/true/on/yes), defaulting to off, to trust
                       all clients as trusted.  See
                       trusted_upstream_proxies.

      enable_put = web_server mode.  Boolean.  defaults to off.
      


enable <service>                   -- enable a service (start listening)
disable <service>                  -- disable a service (stops listening)

header <service> remove <header>           -- remove a header before going to backend node
header <service> insert <header>: <value>  -- insert a header before going to backend node

load <plugin>              -- load a plugin
unload <plugin>            -- unload a plugin

plugins                    -- list plugins

xs                         -- show status of XS modules loaded
xs enable <module>         -- turn on an already-loaded XS module
xs disable <module>        -- turn off an already-loaded XS module

show service               -- list all services
show service <service>     -- show details of given service
show pool                  -- list all pools, nodes, and services using them
show pool <poolname>       -- show members of a pool

reproxy_state              -- dump state of reproxy status

server <param> = <value>   -- set a server parameter, where param is one of:
   max_reproxy_connections
   max_connections
   nice_level
   aio_mode                : one of "none", "linux" (Linux::AIO), or "ioaio" (IO::AIO)
                             This controls how disk IO is done asynchronosly.  Highly recommended
                             to use Linux::AIO or IO::AIO for webserving or reproxying files.
                             For purely reverse proxy or only reproxying URLs, none is fine.
   aio_threads             : number of child threads doing disk IO.  (use between 2-50)
   track_obj               : developer option to track objects


Diagnostic commands:

fd                         -- show file descriptors in use
proc                       -- show CPU usage, current time, pid, and total requests processed
nodes                      -- show BackendHTTP statistics for all backend nodes
node <ip[:port]>           -- show BackendHTTP statistics for specified node
prof on                    -- enable profiling
prof off                   -- disable profiling
prof data                  -- dump profile data
uptime                     -- show time server was started, and current uptime
track                      -- dump out objects tracked, sorted by age
