                           Perlbal Service parameters

   Set via the command:

 SET <service-name>.<param> = <value>

   Note on types: 'bool' values can be set using one of 1, true, yes, on, 0,
   false, off, or no. 'size' values are in integer bytes, or an integer
   followed by 'b', 'k', or 'm' (case-insensitive) for bytes, KiB, or MiB.
