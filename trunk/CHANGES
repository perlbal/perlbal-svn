    -- now that we support persistent connections, the 'queues' command didn't
       have an accurate time; added ClientProxy member last_request_time so
       we can accurately tell how long requests have been waiting for

    -- Danga::Socket got an overhaul; close and steal_socket now share a lot
       of code by calling _cleanup.  some more paranoia on making sure the
       object isn't already closed when we try to do things.

    -- lots more paranoia in close events and event_err handling for backends

    -- added tracking mode for helping look for leaked objects; records a
       backtrace of every object created.  "server track_obj = 0/1" to enable
       or disable it, and then "tracking" in a management interface to see.

    -- made Perlbal::objctor/objdtor take an object as their first parameter.
       much faster than using caller().

    -- fix Highpri plugin to not check hosts for high priority values when
       the host isn't defined

    -- made Palimg plugin far more paranoid about errors, and also uses new
       ClientHTTPBase scratch area for keeping track of data instead of using
       headers (which are generally slower)

    -- fixed bug in HTTPHeaders that set_version would inadvertently
       run into when used on a header created through new_response

    -- ClientProxy class now supports persistence; set persist_client on
       the proxy service in order to enable it.

    -- Palimg plugin now supports fallback to web server mode if the
       requested URI doesn't fit our desired pattern

    -- did some cleanup; made a bunch of HTTPHeaders accesses use the
       accessor methods instead of referencing into the object's private
       store of data

    -- fixed a crash caused by calling getsockname/getpeername on sockets
       that have been undefined after having been stolen during an internal
       redirect to another webserver

    -- fixed _simple_response to not return a body if we're serving
       to a HEAD request

    -- bug fix: don't send Not-Modified responses to requests for dynamic
       directory listings.  it was messing up persistent connections
       since the directory serving code didn't get passed down whether we
       were sending a body or not.  and not modifies on directories are hard:
       modify time isn't altogether useful.  (file sizes could change)

       this still does not-modifieds on indirect index.html directory
       requests, because _serve_request ends up eventually calling
       _serve_request on a different URI.  (brad)

    -- added BSD::Resource as dependency to Makefile.PL (brad)

    -- fixed 304 Not Modified responses to not send Content-Length
       and Content-Type headers.  (jr)

1.01 (2004-10-22)
    -- when internally redirecting a URL, perlbal advertises
       that it supports persisent HTTP connections now,
       and caches those sockets for 5 seconds.  (not configurable)
       useful under load, otherwise you waste all local ports
       on a machine

    -- ditch dependence on IO::SendFile.  do it ourselves (1 line)
       with perl's syscall function

    -- add doc/* and conf/* to MANIFEST file

1.00
    -- initial packaged release
